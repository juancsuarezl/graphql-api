# graphql-api
Server-side CRUD API using GraphQL, TypeOrm, Typescript and Node.js

1. Check out configuration option in src/config/typeorm.ts
2. Start running your local server (Wamp, Xamp, etc), by setting Apache and MySQL to "START".
3. Open the terminal on your computer or your Code Editor (I recommend to use VSCode).
4. Change the directory to your project root path, to run the API.
5. Install dependencies, using npm install.
6. to run the API, write npm run dev on your terminal's prompt
7. Open your localhost at the following address: localhost:3001/graphql to run the GraphQL editor
